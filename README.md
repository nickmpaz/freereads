# Freereads

## About 

A terminal-based application that searches Library Genesis for e-books and 
displays the results. The user can then download the book, and the application
will send it directly to their Amazon Kindle.

Freereads is built with Python. The terminal display is handled with curses. 
Interaction with Library Genesis and its mirror sites is done with Requests 
and BeautifulSoup4. Emailing is done through Gmail's smtp server.

## Demo

Downloading "Inferno" by Larry Niven, and sending it to an email.

    SENDER_PASSWORD="your_gmail_password"

### Email configuration

For a Gmail account to be used by the application, it must "allow less secure apps" 
(It may be smart to create a seperate Gmail account). How to do this:

Whichever Gmail account you use, the account must be added to your Amazon account as an 
approved email. How to do this:
